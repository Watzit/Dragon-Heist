A BAR BRAWL IN THE [[YAWNING PORTAL]] PROVES that nowhere is safe from the gang war between the Zhentarim and the [[Xanathar]] Guild. In this atmosphere of danger, the characters are offered a quest by [[Volothamp Geddarm]]. Volo promises a reward if they can rescue  
his missing friend, [[Floon Blagmaar]], who he fears has been caught up in the conflict. Volo's quest is a straightforward introduction to the streets of [[Waterdeep]], providing the characters with an excuse to explore the city.

In their hunt for Volo's friend, the characters might make allies and enemies who can resurface throughout the adventure. Following the completion of Volo's quest, the characters gain a home base with an address in Trollskull Alley, in [[Waterdeep]]'s North Ward. From their new base, the characters can plot their own course, whether it involves interacting with [[Waterdeep]]'s people, joining one of the city's many factions, or simply poking around for danger.

WHERE TO START

This adventure assumes that the characters have already formed a party and arc presently in the [[Yawning Portal]], perhaps knocking back a pint of Shadowdark ale and wolfing down a plate of quipper and chips. Alternatively, you can begin this adventure as the characters first enter the raucous tavern, or by having them all meet for the first time as Volo hands them their initial quest.

Read the follow- ing to set the scene:
____
"You sit around a sturdy wooden table lit by a brightly burning candle and littered with plates cleared of food and half-drained tankards. The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of a young bard three tables over."
____
Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: "Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?" Then a seven-foot-tall half- orc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump Into the fray. The half-ore cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure- but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?

The human combatants are five members of the Xana- thar Guild (CE human bandits). The one with the eye- shaped tattoos on his bald pate is their leader, Krentz. Their foe, Yagra Strongfist, is a half-ore employed by the Zhentarim (see the [[Yawning Portal]] Friendly Faces handout in appendix C). Yagra fights for her pride.

GETTING INVOLVED  
If the characters choose to join the fray, have everyone roll initiative. But the fight is almost over by the time they push through the rowdy spectators. Krentz has only 3 hit points remaining and is trying to escape from underneath Yagra, but the four other [[Xanathar]] Guild members are poised to tackle her.

Pu!ling Yagra away from Krentz requires a successful Strength check contested by Yagra's Strength check. Yagra thanks the characters if they help her, but is disap- pointed that they interfered in the fight.

Remember how the characters deal with Krentz in this scene. Ifhe survives, the characters might meet him again in one of the [[Xanathar]] Guild's sewer hideouts (see area QS, page 28).

HANGING BACK  
1fthe characters don't interfere in the brawl, Yagra knocks Krentz out cold but is then beaten unconscious by his companions. Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawn- ing Portal, points toward the door. "Out!" he snarls, and the [[Xanathar]] Guild members flee carrying Krentz's un- conscious form.

TROLL AND FRIENDS

In the third round of the brawl, trouble arises from out of the gaping well in the middle of the Yawning Por- tal's taproom:

Shouts of alarm suddenly ring out as a hulking creature climbs up out of the shaft in the middle of the tap· room-a monster with warty green skin, a tangled nest of wiry black hair, a long, carrot-shaped nose, and blood· shot eyes. As it bares its yellow teeth and howls, you can see that a half-dozen bat-like creatures are attached to its body, with three more circling above it like flies. Everyone in the tavern reacts in fear except for the barkeep, Durnan, who shouts, "Troll!"

The troll, which currently has 44 hit points, has crawled up from the first level of Undermountain to feed on tasty humanoid flesh, bringing nine stirges with it. Once in the taproom, the troll rises to its full height of 9 feet

and rolls initiative. The stirges also roll initiative, but only the three flying above the troll pose a threat. The remaining stirges are bloated, having drained copious amounts of the troll's blood, and fly back down the shaft to digest their meal. As the troll regenerates, the effects of its blood loss become less apparent.

Most tavern patrons and staffers flee or take cover  
at the sight of the troll. The stirges attack the nearest characters as Durnan (see appendix B) draws his great- sword, springs over the bar, and confronts the monster himself. As he attacks, he calls on the characters to focus on s laying the stirges and then douse the troll with lamp oil and set it on fire when it falls. Yagra joins the fight if she's conscious. To any characters who help defeat the troll, Durnan says matter-of-factly, "You fought well."

If any of the characters are reduced to 0 hit points during the fight, employees of the [[Yawning Portal]] step forward to stabilize them.

MEETING VOLO

Once the troll and the stirges are dealt with, Volo pushes against the tide of patrons staying clear of th~ monster to greet the characters, lavishing praise on them for their bravery (whetherjustified or not): "You be adventurers, am I right? I could use your help. Let's find a table to talk, shall we?"

[[Volothamp Geddarm]] is known to most Waterdavians as a braggart and a notorious embellisher of facts. For all his faults, though, Volo is a soft-hearted sort who cares for nothing as much as his friends. At present, he is grievously concerned for the well-being of one of them. He begins his request with an air of charm and mystery, but it quickly devolves into tearful sincerity.

The figure who approached you strokes his mustache, adjusts his floppy hat, and tightens his scarf. "[[Volothamp Geddarm]], chronicler, wizard, and celebrity, at your service. I trust you've noted the violence in ou r fair city these past tendays. I haven't seen so much blood since my last visit to Baldur's Gate! But now I fear I have mis- placed a friend amid this odious malevolence.

"My friend's name is [[Floon Blagmaar]]. He's got more beauty than brains, and I worry he took a bad way home a couple nights ago and was kidnapped-or worse. If you agree to track him down with all due haste, I can offer you ten dragons apiece now, and I can give you each ten times that when you find Floon. May I prevail upon you in my hour ofneed?"

Volo gives each character a small pouch containing 10 gp simply for accepting his quest. Characters who want to discover his intentions must make a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a success, a character discerns that Volo is honest but might be stretching the truth about how much he can pay. (Currently low on cash, Volo is awaiting royalty payments from Volo's Guide to Mon- sters. To make more coin. he began work on a new book, Vo/o's Guide to Spirits and Specters. As it happens, his knowledge ofspirits mostly concerns the alcoholic vari- ety, and the writing has not been going well.) If pressed, Volo urges the characters to trust him, and promises he'll have the rest of the reward, 100 gp per character, ready to deliver once Floon is returned to him alive.

Volo describes Floon as a handsome human male in his early thirties with wavy red-blond hair. He was dressed in princely garb when Volo last saw him. Two nights ago, before Floon disappeared, he and Volo were drinking and merrymaking at the Skewered Dragon, a dark, bawdy tavern in the Dock Ward. Volo recommends that the characters start their search there.

WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT?  
Volo is embarrassed to admit he might have gotten his friend Floon in trouble, and he resists providing all the details ofwhat happened the night Floon disappeared.

Beset by writer's block, Volo met [[Floon Blagmaar]] for drinks at the Skewered Dragon two nights ago. They drank and gambled for a few hours, and then Volo left. That's the last he saw of Floon.

Unbeknownst to Volo, not long after he departed, a drunken Floon met another acquaintance, Lord Ren- aer Neverember, at the tavern. The two left together, with Renaer offering to walk Floon home. Five Zhen- tarim thugs working for Urstul Floxin (see appendix B) jumped both Floon and Renaer. They took them to  
a warehouse in the Dock Ward, so they could question Renaer- the son of Lord Dagult Neverember-about the whereabouts of the Stone ofGolorr and his father's hidden cache of dragons. Before the interrogation could begin, members of the [[Xanathar]] Guild ambushed and killed the Zhent guards in the warehouse. The new arrivals mistook Floon for Renaer, knocked Floon un- conscious, and dragged him away while Renaer hid and escaped their notice.

Floon was taken to a [[Xanathar]] Guild hideout in the sewers. A small gang of kenku was left behind at the Zhentarim warehouse to kill any other Zhents who might show up at the warehouse. The presence of the kenku has prevented Renaer from trying to leave the warehouse.

FINDING FLOON

Volo last saw Floon outside the S kewered Dragon, a dubious (and Zhentarim-owned) tavern between Net Street and Fillet Lane in the DockWard. The following encounters kick off the characters' investigation.

En route to the tavern, ·'Blood in the Streets" is a chance for characters to see the City Watch in action. If the characters decide to look around, "Searching the Dock Ward'"gives them a feel for their surroundings, and they might discover a strange place, "Old Xoblob S hop," that warrants further exploration. Once they ar- rive at their destination, "The Skewered Dragon" is an opportunity for the characters to get information from the patrons, which leads them to "Candle Lane,"' where their quest continues.

BLOOD IN THE STREETS  
As the characters travel through the Dock Ward, they come upon the aftermath of a bloody clash between the [[Xanathar]] Guild and the Zhentarim:

As you turn a corner, you find yourselves on a street that has been cordoned off by the City Watch. Lying on the cobblestones are a half-dozen corpses, seemingly the victims of some terrible skirmish. Watch officers have disarmed and arrested three blood-drenched humans and are in the midst ofquestioning witnesses. One of the officers sees you. "Get on," she says. "Nothing to see here."

The skirmish that occurred here has nothing to do with Floon·s disappearance but represents an escalation in the conflict between the Zhentarim and the [[Xanathar]] Guild. A dozen guards of the City Watch have arrested three bandits and are questioning witnesses while waiting for wagons to take away the criminals and

the corpses. The survivors of the skirmish have been stripped of their weapons and forced to kneel with their hands on their heads. All three, loyal Zhentarim agents (employed by Urstul Floxin; see appendix B). are likely to be accused of murder. They coldly catch the eye of anyone who passes by, but the City Watch won't let the characters anywhere near the prisoners.

SEARCHING THE DOCK W ARD  
The Dock Ward is unsafe. You can set the mood by read- ing the following to the players:

ITall, densely packed tenements leave most of the neighborhood in shadow at ground level. Most of the streetlamps have had their glass smashed and their candles stolen, and the smells of salt air and excrement linger as you pass by rows of run-down buildings.

On the corner of Zastrow Street and Fillet Lane is a shop with a peculiar window display:

One nearby shop stands out from the others. It has a deep purple facade, and in its window hangs a stuffed beholder. Above the door hangs a sign whose elaborate letters spell out "Old Xoblob Shop."

If the characters check out the shop. continue with "Old Xoblob Shop."' If they don't. they find the tavern without further incident; see "The Skewered Dragon"' below.

O LD XOBLOB SHOP  
When the characters enter, they quickly get a sense of the strangeness of the place:

A cloud of lavender-scented purple smoke trails out of the shop's door as you peer inside. Every wall is painted purple, and every dusty knickknack on the shelves is dyed a deep violet. The hairless old gnome sitting cross- legged on the counter wears plum-colored robes. His cheeks are decorated with nine purple face-painted eyes.

The gnome lowers a pipe and exhales a cloud of lav- ender smoke before raising a hand. "Hail and well met! lCome browse the shelves ofthe most curious curiosity shop in the world! "

The shop is named after the stuffed beholder in the win- dow-a fixture that is actually a magical sensor, through which [[Xanathar]] can peer whenever it wishes.

The shopkeeper is a wizened deep gnome who spies for the [[Xanathar]] Guild. A few years ago, he survived the detonation of a gas spore in Undermountain and inherited some stray beholder memories. Driven by a compulsion to carve out his own domain, the gnome settled in [[Waterdeep]], bought the Old Xoblob Shop from its previous owner, and tried renaming it after himself, yet everyone kept calling it the Old Xoblob Shop. He therefore restored the old name and changed his name to Xoblob. ·'No relation to the eye tyrant hanging in the window!" he says.

Trinkets. The gnome sells an assortment of trinkets. As the characters search the shelves, roll on the Trin- kets table in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook to de- termine what catches their eye. Xoblob sells any trinket for ld6 gp.

Floon's Fate. The gnome doesn't know Floon by name, but he recognizes liis description. He is reluctant to share information, but offering him a new purple item or succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check loosens his tongue. He says that Floon and a well-dressed fellow of similar appearance and bearing ([[Renaer Neverember]], though the gnome doesn't know his name and didn't recognize him) were

jumped outside the shop by rough-looking men in black leather armor. Xoblob thinks there were five attackers, but none of them looked familiar. One of them had a black tattoo ofa winged snake on his neck.

THE SKEWERED DRAGON  
The Skewered Dragon faces an alley that runs between Net Street and Fillet Lane in the Dock Ward, not far from the Old Xoblob Shop. When the characters ap- proach it, read:

The Skewered Dragon looks like a ruin. Both of its front-facing windows are smashed, and a ship's anchor is lodged in the roof. Through the windows, you can see a group of haggard patrons drinking from huge tankards.

Floon has not been at the Skewered Dragon since the night of his disappearance, and the dive's dockworker patrons are loath to talk to strangers. A bribe or a suc- cessful DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check gets them to open up.

Floon's Fate. Several of the regulars remember see- ing Volo and Floon drinking together a couple of nights ago. After Volo left, Floon stuck around long enough to meet with another friend: [[Renaer Neverember]], the son of [[Waterdeep]]'s previous Open Lord, Dagult Neverember. "Chip off the old block, that one!" sneers one patron. 'Just another spoiled, rich noble who likes to rub our noses in it!" says another.

ThetwodrankandplayedafewroundsofThree- Dragon Ante before leaving around midnight. Five men followed them out, and no one in the tavern knows what happened after that. The men who left shortly after Floon and Renaer haven't returned to the tavern since, but they're known to frequent a warehouse on Candle Lane. "Look for the snake symbol on the door," says one of the tavern regulars.

CANDLE LANE  
The buildings on either side of Candle Lane are so tall

and so tightly packed together that light touches the street only at highsun.

Gloom envelops a narrow alley as dark as a dungeon- and as odorous as one, too. Nearly all the streetlamps have been smashed. The only light that pierces the darkness is a faint flickering from down the lane, like a distant candle.

The flickering comes from the one streetlamp still intact on Candle Lane, kept alight by a continual flame spell.  A warehouse is directly across the street from the lamp, which illuminates a black winged snake (the symbol of the Zhentarim) painted above the door's handle. Char- acters who have ties to the Zhentarim recognize the symbol, while others can recall its significance with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check.
