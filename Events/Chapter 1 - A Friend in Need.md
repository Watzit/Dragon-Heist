A BAR BRAWL IN THE YAWNING PORTAL PROVES that nowhere is safe from the gang war between the Zhentarim and the Xanathar Guild. In this atmosphere of danger, the characters are offered a quest by Volothamp Geddarm. Volo promises a reward if they can rescue  
his missing friend, Floon Blagmaar, who he fears has been caught up in the conflict. Volo's

quest is a straightforward introduction to the streets of Waterdeep, providing the characters with an excuse to explore the city.

IntheirhuntforVolo'sfriend, thecharactersmight make allies and enemies who can resurface throughout the adventure. Following the completion ofVolo's quest, the characters gain a home base with an address in Trollskull Alley, in Waterdeep's North Ward. From their new base, the characters can plot their own course, whether it involves interacting with Waterdeep's people, joining one of the city's many factions, or simply poking around for danger.

WHERE TO START

This adventure assumes that the characters have al- ready formed a party and arc presently in the Yawning Portal, perhaps knocking back a pint of Shadowdark ale and wolfing down a plate of quipper and chips. Alterna- tively, you can begin this adventure as the characters first enter the raucous tavern, or by having them all meet for the first time as Volo hands them their initial quest.

TAVERN BRAWL

As the characters are relaxing in the taproom of the Yawning Portal. a fistfight breaks out. Read the follow- ing to set the scene:
____
"You sit around a sturdy wooden table lit by a brightly burning candle and littered with plates cleared of food and half-drained tankards. The sounds of gamblers yelling and drunken adventurers singing bawdy songs nearly drown out the off-key strumming of a young bard three tables over."
____
Then all the noise is eclipsed by a shout: "Ya pig! Like killin' me mates, does ya?" Then a seven-foot-tall half- orc is hit by a wild, swinging punch from a male human whose shaved head is covered with eye-shaped tattoos. Four other humans stand behind him, ready to jump Into the fray. The half-ore cracks her knuckles, roars, and leaps at the tattooed figure- but before you can see if blood is drawn, a crowd of spectators clusters around the brawl. What do you do?

The human combatants are five members of the Xana- thar Guild (CE human bandits). The one with the eye- shaped tattoos on his bald pate is their leader, Krentz. Their foe, Yagra Strongfist, is a half-ore employed by the Zhentarim (see the Yawning Portal Friendly Faces handout in appendix C). Yagra fights for her pride.
