ZHENTARIM HIDEOUT

The hideout on Castle Lane (see map 1.1) is a ram- shackle two-story warehouse. The Black Network has other sanctuaries in run-down buildings like this one throughout Waterdeep (meaning that the floor plan of this locale can be reused for other Zhent hideouts).

The warehouse stands at the back of an outer yard be- hind a high fence. The gate on the fence isn't locked. The building's three points ofentry-a front door, a large warehouse loading door, and a painted-over window- are locked. The front door has a sliding peephole that can be opened from the inside. Either of the doors or

the window can be unlocked by a character who makes a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or can be forced open with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.

Knocking at the doors or the window alerts a group of kenku inside that someone is coming. The kenku scram- ble to hide behind toppled furniture, making a ruckus that any character who has a passive Wisdom (Percep- tion) score of 16 or higher can hear. These kenku are all that remain of the Xanathar Guild force that murdered almost everyone in the warehouse after the five Zhen- tarim thugs captured Renaer Neverember and Floon Blagmaar and brought them here. Floon was taken

away, but Renaer succeeded in staying alive by hiding. Now, the young noble is trying to figure out how to slip past the kenku, who are lazily searching the warehouse for loot while waiting to see if any more Zhents show up.
