The door to this back room hangs loosely on broken hinges. The cramped chamber beyond smells strongly ofsour fish and vinegar. It is filled with discarded ropes. canvas tarpaulins, and splintered wood from smashed barrels. Renaer Neverember (see appendix B) is hjding here, having slipped free of his rope bonds. The charac- ters can hear his ragged breathing coming from under a tarpaulin at the north end of the room.

ROLEPLAYING RENAER  
Renaer is unarmed. Marred by grime and the lingering stench of rancid pickled herring, he speaks with grace and articulation, as befits his noble upbringing. His trust is easily gained but impossible to restore once broken.
