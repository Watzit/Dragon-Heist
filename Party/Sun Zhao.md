Aesthetic: Hailing from Kara-Tur, far to the east of Faerun, Sun Zhao is yellowish-bronze in hue, with black hair and dark eyes. He is is almost completely bald at the top, but retaining some long strangly hairs on the sides. He is unkept, wearing a dirty white vest with the elvish word for soup written on it. He is wearing tan shorts and well worn flip flops where one of the heels has begun to split. Backstory: Zhao had a boring, completely uneventful childhood living in the most populous city of Kara-Tur, and that was precisely the problem. People were boring, the city was smelly and the food was rotten and there were too many rules. Living in isolation in the mountains and forests of Kara-Tur, Zhao explored the lands in search of spiritual enlightenment and challenges of strength and will. After decades of exploration and living almost entirely alone, Zhao felt compelled to rejoin civilisation to test his strength and find new direction towards enlightenment.
