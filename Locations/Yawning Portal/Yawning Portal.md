The Yawning Portal is a famous inn and tavern located in the Castle Ward ofWaterdeep. Adventurers can meet all sorts of colorful characters here.

The place is a stone building with a slate roof and several chimneys. Most of the ground floor is taken  
up by the tavern's common room, which contains a 40-foot-diameter open well (actually the outershell ofa sunken stone tower) that descends 140 feet to the first level of Undermountain, the sprawling dungeon under [[Waterdeep]]. A rope-and-pulley mechanism is used to lower adventurers into the well and hoist them out. More information about this entrance to Undermountain can be found in [[Waterdeep]]: Dungeon ofthe Mad Mage.

The upper floors of the Yawning Portal contain com- fortable. nicely appointed rooms for guests.

Durnan, the proprietor, charges standard prices for food, drink, and lodging (see chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook for costs).

FAMILIAR FACES

Give the Yawning Portal Familiar Faces handout in appendix C to the players, and allow each of them to select one NPC as a friendly acquaintance- someone the player's character knows and trusts. More than one player can select the same NPC. The information below

should be withheld from the players until their charac- ters learn il.

DURNAN  
N male llluskan human innkeeper

The proprietor of the Yawning Portal is a retired adven- turer and a man of few words. Durnan (see appendix B) bluntly warns adventurers of lower than 5th level that entering Undermountain "isn't a good idea."' He keeps

a magic greatsword hidden behind the bar just in case something monstrous crawls up out of the entry well.

MA TTRIM "THREESTRINGS" MEREG LG male !Uuskan human bard

This socially awkward bard (see appendix B) performs at the Yawning Portal and is a better musician than  
he pretends to be. He's called "Threestrings" because he plays a lute that has only three strings remaining. His secret is that he's a Harper spy, and he's far more eloquent and composed than he lets on. He lives at the inn, where he spends his afternoons and evenings spy- ing on Zhentarim agents and gathering information on other potential troublemakers. He recently befriended Bonnie and wants to help her doppelganger gang settle into the city.

jALESTER SILVERMANE

LG male Chondathan human lighter

Jalester Silvermane (see appendix B) is an agent of the Lords' Alliance who reports directly to Laeral Silver- hand. The Open Lord of [[Waterdeep]] has asked him to spy on adventurers who might, through their actions, aid or imperil the city and its citizens. Since the Yawning Portal attracts adventurers of all sorts,Jalester spends a lot of time here, usually seated by himself in a quiet cor- ner. Durnan knows thatjalester works for Laeral and leaves the young man alone.

Jalester is often distracted by thoughts of Faerrel Dun- blade, his boyfriend, who was killed in a street fight last year. When not engaged in alliance business. jalester is lonely and looking for love.

An intellect devourer in league with [[Xanathar]] ate Meloon's brain several months ago. Now under the mon- ster's control, Meloon actively discourages adventurers from exploring Undermountain and urges them to focus on conflicts in the city instead. He also hunts down and kills Zhentarim operatives for his secret beholder mas- ter. He has his eye on Davil Starsong (see appendix B) but won't kill the elf in plain view of witnesses.

dermountain but is happy to help them with her magic until they gain enough experience to be useful to her.

Y AGRA STONEFIST  
N female half-ore thug-for-hire

Yagra is a Black Network mercenary who gets paid to protect a Zhent negotiator named Davil Starsong (see appendix B for more information on him). Yagra finds the job boring and likes to pass the time by challenging adventurers to arm wrestle. (Resolve such contests using contested Strength checks.)

Yagra is a half-ore thug. When reduced to 0 hit points, she drops to 1 bit point instead (but can't do this again until she finjshes a long rest). She has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. She speaks Common and Ore.
